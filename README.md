static-site
=======

Build static sites using grunt.

Setup
-----

`git clone https://github.com/rath3r/static-site.git .`

Don't forget the trailing full stop or you'll get a new directory inside your project dir as well.

Make sure you have `node` and `npm` installed.

`Grunt` is also required. `Grunt` needs to be installed globally using:

`npm install -g grunt-cli`

Once everything is installed run:

`npm install`

This will install the dependencies for this project in the node_modules directory.

Usage
-----

`grunt`
